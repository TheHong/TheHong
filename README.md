<h1> Hello! <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width = 30px> </h1>

In this day and age, it's so easy to get caught up in our work and forget that we are still human. So I want to take a moment and ask:

<h3 align="center" fontWeight: "bold">
  How are you doing?<br/>
  How are you feeling today?

Hello and welcome again! I'm a passionate individual who loves to interact with others, learn new things, and apply technology to address the world's most pressing problems. I always have fun doing projects, especially those that are impactful. I've done projects in various fields whether it be a project for a hackathon, a club, research, or just for personal fun! 

(The projects in my Github profile are only a small sample of the things that I've done. Impactful solutions require more than just code ðŸ’ª. Feel free to reach out to me through LinkedIn or email to learn more!ðŸ˜€)
